Hello!

Thank you for taking the time to look at this project.

To get it to run you will need to re-add the References (stored in the ReferenceAssembiles folder),
You will also have to change the DriverLocation property in the Constants class (TestHelpers.Constants).

For the test framework I am using NUnit as it has quite a few advantages over MSTest (Even know I am not taking advantage in this solution currently).

Last thing! You need Firefox installed, if you don't want this then comment out this line in the HomePageTest.cs:
    [TestFixture(typeof(FirefoxDriver)), Category("Firefox")]

There are some known problems with the IEDriver when using IE11. You need to do some local configuration to fix this unfortunatly.
This is why it is good to use the Grid solution Selenium provide :)

These tests should all pass but because there are a few issues on the form these tests are failing. E.g. having the Approved Date in the past.
